title: add readline support
desc: |-
  From ry:
  
  Hi Scott,
  
  I just wanted to alert you that there is a primitive readline library
  in Node now.
  
  http://github.com/ry/node/blob/6056d2ea2c5e158f9a0daaad4bd242c405e49ab3/lib/readline.js
  
  I hope you'll be able to use it in ndb. Let me know what issues you hit
