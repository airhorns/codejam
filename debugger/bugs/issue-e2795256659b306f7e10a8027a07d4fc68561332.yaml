title: list command consistency
desc: |-
  the list command should consistenly follow other gdb like debuggers:
  
  "l" should print the current line.  Invoking it a second time should show the next X lines
  "l=" should always print the current line
  "l+" should show the next set of lines (as if invoking l for a second time)
  "l+X" should show the next X lines of input
  "l-X" should do the same, but in reverse
  "l 1-100" should show lines 1-100
  "l 10" should print as if on line 10
