* node 0.3.0 support

== 0.2.0 / 2010-08-20
* bugfix: Compatibility with node v0.1.97 / v0.2.0.

== 0.1.5 / 2010-05-30
* add history tracking

      1  list
      2  n
      3  history

* repl

  ndb> repl
  Welcome to the ndb repl.
  Type .break to exit.
  repl> this

  repl> .break

== 0.1.4 / 2010-05-20
* Implement backtrace command.
* set host with --host
* use --local option to run script directly -
  a shortcut for starting the script with two commands:

    Instead of:

      $ node --debug-brk my_js.js &
      $ ndb

    The convenience --local is provided:

      ndb --local my_js.js

* wait for remote host to be up.  It'll spin in a loop and look for a connection every two
  seconds instead of bombing out immediately if it doesn't find one.
