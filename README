===== CODE JAM =====


==== Running the application ====
The application consists of 3 components.
 - Redis database server
 - C++ "THEDOMINATOR" backend and protocol implementation
 - Node.js web server + frontent

Ilia knows how to run the Redis server and THEDOMINATOR.

To run the frontend, change to the project directory and run
`node public/server.js`

To run the reference Node.js backend (which is kinda slow in the face of THEDOMINATOR),
run `node server/ipo_server.js`

==== Installation ====
You should install npm. It's a package manager for node.
Install these packages using `npm install <package>`

In production:
 - redis
 - socket.io 
 - express
 - jade

In development
 - nodeunit
 - coffee-script
 - jitter 
 - hexy

==== Compiling Coffeescript files ====
Run `jitter . .` in your project directory.


==== Running Tests ====
Run nodeunit <testfile>.js
